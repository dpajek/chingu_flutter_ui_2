# chingu_flutter (tier 2)

This is a submission for Chingu's Tier 2 Flutter project.
This project demonstrates a news API call that's used to populate a card-based UI built with Flutter. It contains 3 pages.

News articles were retrieved from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/).

Here is a [live web app version](https://dpajek.github.io/flutter-ui-2/#/), though it doesn't work because the free tier for the API only allows access from localhost :\

## Screens
